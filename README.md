# Text-Adventure
This project is a very simple text based adventure that includes codes of an interactive fiction game with sound affects for more realistic way of approach. Also in this code I've used playsound lib for the musics. 
If u feel u do not need the audio version, I can upload them too.
Don't forget to keep the code and audio files under the same folder.

If you also need GUI attached for this game pull requests or I will soon upload it too :)

Any queries with the code? Feel free to contribute or email me at - thiyagarajannarmatha@gmail.com
